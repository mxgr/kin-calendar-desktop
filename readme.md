## Intro

This is a native wrapper for the [Kin Today Calendar app](https://kin.today/) - [Kin Web Client github](https://github.com/KinToday/kin-web-client).

It allows you to run Kin Calendar as a desktop application on your mac.

I used [Nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier) to package the app. It is a command line tool that allows you to easily create a desktop application for any web site with succinct and minimal configuration. Apps are wrapped by [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) in an OS executable (`.app`, `.exe`, etc.) for use on Windows, macOS and Linux.


## Installation

[Download for Mac](https://github.com/mxgr/kin-calendar-desktop/raw/master/kincalendar.app.zip) - unzip and move 'Kin Calendar.app' to your application folder

## Disclaimer

I haven't built Kin Calendar - I only ran a command on my computer to create an executable.
